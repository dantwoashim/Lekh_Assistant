# Validation Report

## Current Decision

Status: controlled web/PWA and Keyboard Lab testing only. The repo-executable keyboard foundation is complete, but native Windows/macOS release is not complete.

Decision: continue controlled user testing for the web/PWA and Keyboard Lab. Native implementation may start from the Prompt 3 scaffolds, but public release remains blocked until platform testing, signing/notarization, and pilot feedback are complete.

Top failure categories:

| Category | Count | Severity mix |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| None in current benchmark | 0 | P0: 0, P1: 0, P2: 0 |

The production bundle lazy-loads the conversion tools. The first-load app shell is now about 200.52 kB minified / 63.63 kB gzip. Heavy local engine/data code is isolated behind lazy chunks: a shared engine chunk of about 2,658.99 kB minified / 452.47 kB gzip and a lazy Hunspell chunk of about 956.51 kB minified / 176.62 kB gzip. This is acceptable for controlled testing but the shared engine/data chunk should be split or compacted before a broad public launch.

## Remaining Failure Categories

- Real Preeti documents: no consented user documents are in the fixture set yet.
- Preeti mixed-English preservation: the current project-owned cases pass, but real documents can still contain unseen English tokens embedded in Preeti text.
- Preeti punctuation/source truth: `?` remains inherently ambiguous in legacy Preeti because it can represent either punctuation or `रु`; source audit now separates verified conversion bugs, ambiguous source encodings, and style/proofread cases.
- Deterministic Preeti decoder: semantic profile maps, greedy tokenization, typed atoms, verifier, compare/auto/atom modes, and fuzz/roundtrip oracle reports are in place. The baseline converter remains the conservative fallback until cutover is proven on real documents.
- Romanized benchmark: current generated/manual/regression/hostile/competitor fixtures pass, but the score is still internal and fixture-driven until manually filled competitor probes and real preview phrases are added. The former `romanized-held-out` suite is contaminated by phrase-pack overlap and is not public proof.
- Romanized alias collisions: the alias factory intentionally reports thousands of ambiguous keys from imported dictionary-derived aliases. These must be ranked/reviewed, not hidden.
- Romanized ranking: phrase/alias coverage is strong on current fixtures; user correction memory still needs real preview examples.
- Engine facade: existing converters are wrapped and mixed-document spans are protected. Lexical authority, Hunspell ranking artifacts, expanded aliases, loanword/preserve dictionaries, sliding-window phrase matching, starter domain packs, proofread hooks, memory scoring, legacy profile diagnostics, real-document protocol, competitor probes, and scorecards are in place.
- Protected span coverage: current hostile cases cover common admin/digital spans, but real mixed Preeti documents can still expose unseen labels or typography.
- Mixed span routing: locked mutation suites now pass with zero silent corruption, but real office documents may still expose unknown span shapes that should become new fixtures.
- Runtime size: the expanded local wordlist is no longer in the initial app shell, but the lazy shared engine/data chunk should still be split or compacted before broad launch.
- Font variants: Kantipur/Sagarmatha/Himali are planned diagnostics only until verified bundle-safe maps exist.
- Spell UX: first Hunspell use is local, lazy-loaded, and debounced, but still a large chunk.
- Legal notices: third-party notices are available in the app shell at `/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.txt`.
- Native keyboard release: TSF/IMK scaffolds and contracts exist, but production native implementation, signing, notarization, installer QA, and pilot feedback remain blocked outside the repo-executable verification loop.

## Launch Checklist

- App renders and tools are above the fold.
- Tests pass.
- Build passes.
- PWA shell is registered and hashed assets are precached.
- No typed text is sent automatically.
- Claims avoid official authority, perfect conversion, and native keyboard support.
- Real Preeti document claims remain blocked until consented document intake is populated.
